# Simple-GNN-for-MD
A GNN for per-atom force prediction in frames from classical dynamic simulation.
To train the model I simulated liquid water using LAMMPS (all the files to generate the data are in "LAMMPS input directory").
The aim is to test the model with a much larger number of molecules than the examples in the training set, and also on simulation of different molecules.

A complete description with the results obtained is in "GNNforMD description.pdf". Some other results and the possibility to explore them can be found in "test.ipynb". Documentation .html files of all the code is ni the "documentation" directory.
